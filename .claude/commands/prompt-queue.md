The user (Daniel) has gathered questions about STT fine-tuning in the prompts folder.

Here's the workflow:

- Prompts that are queued for execution go in to-run 
- Answer them one by one. For each, create a note for this notebook and make sure to add the Claude Code attribution  The base path for the notebook is /home/daniel/repos/github/STT-Fine-Tuning-Notebook/notebook
- Sort the note into the most logical subfolder
- When done, move that prompt into processed and move onto the next one 

The format for outputs (notes/responses should be):

- Summarise Daniel's prompt / question 
- Provide your answer

Note: the prompts themselves were captured iwth STT so ... you may encounter (and have to infer around) some inaccuracies.
