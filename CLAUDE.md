This repository consists of a notebook - mostly AI generated (by you!) regarding the user (Daniel's) questions about ASR and STT and fine tuning. 

Key functions:

- Daniel will ask questions (prompts) in the prompts folder using a  slash command defining the workflow for processing and moving them. 
- The notes themselves will be aggregated into the notebook folder and are organised thematically 

Additionally: sometimes Daniel will ask you to run exports so that he can gather together and print your answers for hard copy reading. 

Your answers should be comprehensive.
