If I was recording training data for ASR and I would assume that the goal would be to capture the best audio quality that I could but if the goal is to get the best accuracy during real-world use then in most cases I'm going to be recording in less than ideal conditions where I'm going to have on my phone there's going to be a background noise, does this mean that I should actually record my training data in less optimal conditions like on my phone with background noise in order to better reflect the type of real-world conditions it's going to be using.
