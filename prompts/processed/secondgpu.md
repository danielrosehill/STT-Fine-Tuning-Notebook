So I've become very enthusiastic about using a speech to text and I do most of my, during the day I work mostly at a desktop and when I got this desktop as an upgrade I wasn't really into AI stuff yet or in fact using speech to text. So I went with an AMD GPU probably for budgetary reasons. What I'm thinking about is if in the future when I, my next build or an upgrade there's two directions I was thinking of. One is just buying an Nvidia GPU and the other is saying okay my current GPU is fine for the screens. Let's buy a second GPU just for running speech to text processing. That's probably the only AI workload that I do locally. I do local language language models a little bit but not to a significant extent. So what direction would you recommend? And if I were buying a second GPU just for speech to text, would I focus on buying a GPU, an NPU, a GPU. TPU.
