For folks who are looking to run speech-to-text workloads locally on AMD GPU, what is the most reliable engine at the moment? I've seen conflicting information. For example, at the moment, I'm trying to use WhisperCPP and I'm using an app for transcription, local transcription that says that it has GPU support with WhisperCPP and I thought it was working but now looking at my resource monitor I'm not really seeing clear indication that the GPU is actually doing anything while the app's being used. I thought I saw in other instances that FasterWhisper actually could work with an AMD GPU. I know it's much more limited than the case with an NVIDIA GPU but just curious as to how the various engines rank and if there's any models use your time working with those engines if they exist.
