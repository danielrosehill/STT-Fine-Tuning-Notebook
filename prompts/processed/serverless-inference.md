For fine-tuned or custom developed ASR models, i am curious to know for inference what the various deployment options are for solo users, although it's maybe kind of a niche that individual users might go to the trouble of doing this. But all I've really found so far for serverless is replicate. And I presume that if you're running something 24-7, otherwise it's going to be very expensive. And so what platforms would be the most kind of feasible ways? And if you were going down the direction of running your ASR model 24-7, whether locally exposed to the internet or in the cloud, what kind of costs would you be looking at?
