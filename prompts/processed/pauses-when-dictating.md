So one of the only things that I don't like about speech recognition ASR tech is it occurred to me after a little bit of time using one of the whisper extensions that sometimes especially when I'm before my morning coffee and I'm recording notes I tend to pause for thoughts could be a long sometimes I really think for 10 seconds if I'm dictating a blog outline, for example and I'm trying to think of the logical order I might just kind of pause sometimes it could be 20 seconds and when you have those long pauses I was told that that's when hallucinations actually slip in which I've seen ideally I'd love to just have an ASR that. Doesn't have that limit I've associated VAD voice activity detection with always on transcription which is something I'm really not interested in using personally as well as Wake Word but does it actually have application for this that it can kind of turn off its attention as such when I'm pausing and then come back on.
