So there's this bug I was noticing on when I tried using my fine tunes my whisper fine tunes for the first time which I was very excited about I tried them out on the desktop and literally got good results that was encouraging and then I tried to put them on Futo on my phone. After converting them to GGUF and some of the model I think it might have been actually tiny. Had this bug in which they would just repeat so if I said I'm going to the shop um they would repeat that sentence like 20 or 30 times over um so it was like it was it was there was definitely some inference happening but it wasn't able to stop and it was kind of caught in this loop I didn't get to the bottom of what um was causing the bug or trying out different models but I'm just curious um whether what that kind of a bug might indicate is it perhaps that the um the conversion process didn't work well and it clues as to what the underlying cause might have been.
