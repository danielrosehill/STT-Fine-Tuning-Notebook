So when we talk about fine-tuning an ASR model, we talk typically about learning vocabulary. Punctuation is something I'm interested in because I'm still unsure whether sometimes I see separate punctuation models, other times I see ASR models that seem to actually have punctuation as part of their inherent capabilities. In either case, the way we punctuate is also a little bit idiosynchronic in the sense that we're not going to be able to do this. There might be several valid ways of punctuating a sentence, and it might be somewhat stylistic upon how the individual prefers to punctuate. Is there any concept of fine-tuning for your specific mode and preferences of punctuation, much as there is for vocabulary?
