So OpenAI has released Whisper and three specific variants of Whisper, and then it's released its own closed-source models on top of that. I presume over time that much as we're seeing large language models getting better, ASR models are going to be progressing and that there's some differences between those three versions of Whisper that were released, although I haven't looked into that. We've reached a point in ASR where the technology is pretty good, but not 100%. What kind of advances are we seeing at the moment to close that final gap between where we are now and, let's say, where we might wish to be, which is kind of really almost flawless transcription. Maybe also it's all the bells and whistles that I think are currently missing, like paragraph support and things of that nature. What are the main kind of developments for at the moment?
