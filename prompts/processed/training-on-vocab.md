Content that included some foreign vocabulary as I live in Israel use some Hebrew words and that's what the ASR struggles with but when I was recording these sentences I might use let's say normal words and then one word that was the target word for training it might be I'm going to the Mekolet and Mekolet means a quickiemart. My question is when the ASR is being fine-tuned it doesn't need to learn the any other part of the sentence I guess except for the phonetics of and the transliteration of the target word so how does it handle that when it's being tuned is it best to actually limit the amount of external or learned vocabulary to increase the signal to noise ratio as it were or does the fine-tuning process handle that kind of surrounding context processing naturally.
