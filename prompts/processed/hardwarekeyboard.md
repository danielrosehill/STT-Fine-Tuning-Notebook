I'll give you a pitch for a idea that I've had and I don't think I'm gonna make it although it would be kind of fun to do a little prototype but it's something I thought would be actually really useful and I'm curious if someone else has made this because if they did I would very much like to buy it as opposed to try to hack it together so something I found in I use Ubuntu Linux I use Wayland and for the voice typing apps the hurdle is actually in text input the transcription generally works and you can find models that will work but Wayland is very restrictive about security and frequently it's actually the virtual input that fails and I thought because this is such a seems like such a silly thing for to break the app. An idea occurred to me. If on-device STT is useful, and we might want to use it across different computers, my desktop might be great for STT, my laptop less so. Why doesn't someone make a mini-computer that its task is just to run an on-device speech-to-text model, and you can connect it via USB or Bluetooth to another computer, and it can present itself as a keyboard. In other words, a dedicated hardware device for doing STT input. Does such a thing exist, or should I give this a go?
