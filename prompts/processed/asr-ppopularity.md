I've been very interested in, got into ASR, the speech technology about this time last year, and always wanted to explore it, especially computer control, but was never really that good on Linux when I tried. And I think since Whisper, it's just become so much better. My question is, is there any, I see, I feel like there's more tools coming online in marketplaces, at marketplaces. Over the course of really as the months go by, is there any demonstrable evidence, quantifiable evidence, showing that there is an increase in use among especially not just business users and enterprises, but people using this technology in their everyday life and embracing speech technology?
