So when gathering training data for speech-to-text models at my first attempt fine-tuning whisper I saw that the training chunks were supposed to be under 30 seconds to match the single inference limit of whisper I'm wondering if that's the case for all ASR models or are there some I haven't fine-tuned other ASRs or are there other ASR models that don't have that restriction and for those models what are the recommended lengths for a single measurements. Chunk the other thing is when recording training data it's I actually quite enjoy recording chunks in the 20 to 30 seconds time frame period because i guess as opposed to recording individual sentences you have to do less individual recordings and there might be a little bit of narrative flow in that period is 20 to 30 seconds okay is it preferable to actually record very small training files as small as a single sentence.
