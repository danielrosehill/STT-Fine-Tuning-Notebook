So you have in ASR So you have in ASR So you have in ASR So you have in ASR. Whisper is the most famous and well known of the models there's a number of other ones and I'm looking at the hugging face ASR selection at the moment and it lists there being 26,713 models which seems like an extraordinary amount and I think that's kind of a little bit exaggerated because a lot of those are actually personal fine tunes etc but there still are some there is some long tail of models so the names that I'm seeing just looking at the kind of trending table here are NVIDIA's models you have Parakeet Canary i'm looking also at Breeze ASR Meta have a couple of models there is Wav2 Vec2 yet when I'm looking at what I can use on Android and on computer transcription seems to always be variations on Whisper so I'm wondering for these additional models what are they what differentiates them and how does their accuracy compare to Whisper and are these ASR models all sort of fundamentally ahead of the older models that we would have seen on Linux in the past some of which I think aren't actually AI models.
