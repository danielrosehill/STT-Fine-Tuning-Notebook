Every voice is unique. And I guess even within a linguistic group, one of the challenges of ASR models is that one model attempts to fit so many different accents and voices. What I'm really interested to know is besides fine tuning, if you wanted to run a hypothetical evaluation to find your best baseline ASR model, is there any way that one could do that sort of reliably? And what kind of characteristics of the voice beyond your accent, maybe your speaking cadence, might lend itself towards a different ASR model being better or worse in your case?
