Something that I found very surprising, something that I found very surprising, when I've been doing these fine-tunings for speech attacks models, is that there doesn't seem to be really any streamlined way to do this, by which I mean if I take an audio data set, and I want to fine-tune, let's say, Whisper, it's still really looking for notebooks. Unsloth, which is quite a nice tool, will direct you towards their notebooks in the first instance. And it seems surprising to me that there isn't like a cloud service where you can just kind of pay to train up your fine-tune, or even really a GUI. Why is the case this? Is it the case, I guess, but why does it seem to be so relatively speaking a custom process and a bespoke process, where I would have thought there's quite a need or interest in fine-tuning ASR models, But there doesn't seem to be the supporting technology to make it sort of relatively easy. If I was trying to, you know, explain to a non-technical or less-tight-centric friend how to fine-tune it, by the time I start talking about Python notebooks and Google Colab, they're going to be already confused. So what explains the lack of sort of friendliness in ASR.
