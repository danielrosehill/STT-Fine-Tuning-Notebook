So if you go on hugging face, there is quite a number of variations on Whisper. Given the fact that it was open sourced, you have distilled Whisper, Crisper, Whisper, and different models. And I've always been curious what the advantages of using these are over DocWhisper. I see different projects using different or offering different variations. Is it hardware specific? Are they, in some cases, more advanced, or what's the rationale to use these as opposed to using the original models?
