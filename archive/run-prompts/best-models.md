I'd love to get your feelings on which of the ASR models are more and less suited to fine tuning. Whisper seems to be the one that dominates people's focus and attention. It's certainly a stellar model, but there's a lot of different models. The ASR category on hugging face is particularly active, and I'm just wondering what the pros and cons of fine tuning on those different bars is compared to Whisper.
