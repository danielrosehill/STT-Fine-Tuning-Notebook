So I'm using an app called SpeechNote on Linux, and it's quite a nice transcription app. And it has a complementary model for punctuation restoration. I'm just wondering, when you use stock ASR models, I assume that Whisper by itself doesn't provide any support for punctuation, although I feel like, having said that, I've used just Whisper and seen that it did add punctuation. So what's the case, and why, if I can add punctuation, the other thing that I find really lacking when I'm using speech-to-text in day-to-day productivity is that it doesn't have any concept of paragraph breaks, which means that if I'm transcribing something and then want to use it as an email, even if it gets the punctuation and the transcription perfect, I'm still going to have to go in and manually find the logical paragraph breaks because no one wants to read or send a single wall-of-text style email. So why is that the case, and are there any, if there's a complementary app for punctuation restoration, then why isn't there one for paragraph spacing.
