And so I've noticed that for fine-tuning, a lot of effort goes into ensuring the data structure is correct in which you have the audio files and the source of truth. Actually, when I was first creating these, I thought it made sense to have individual text files, and then I see the standard approaches using them is actually just having the text in the JSON metadata that defines the connections between the audio files and the... On the text, um... What is the name for this standard audio dataset format that seems to have been kind of decided upon or very much standardized by HuggingFace? And where can I find, if I ever wanted to find, for reference, the exact definition? If there is such a thing, then where would I find that?
