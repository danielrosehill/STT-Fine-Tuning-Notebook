So I unintentionally wound up with an AMD GPU before I got into AI, and for many AI things, AMD is very limiting. There is much more support for NVIDIA, and I'm always trying to think for ASR and AI in general, what's the best way to work with, rather than against, this limitation. For inference on AMD and ROCM, what are the specific engines that have the best support, and what formats, for that reason, make the most sense to target when you're converting from your raw safe-tensors file after the fine tuning.
