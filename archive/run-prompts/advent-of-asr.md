I'd love to get a general sense for the evolution of ASR. I know that when AI exploded in popularity, so did Whisper, and looking into it, I saw the commonality in the transformer architecture. I'm just wondering, in the Linux world, there is still a lot of, or you still see mention of older speech-to-text projects, which I explored years ago and didn't find particularly useful. And I can see with Whisper, what really got me into this is that I noticed immediately there was a very significant improvement in accuracy and reliability that actually, I'd say, made the technology viable. So when did that occur? Was Whisper the first, were the previous ones? And explain, I guess, the fundamentals and the architectural differences between what we have now and what came before in the world of speech-to-text.
