# ASR and STT AI Notebook - Prompts & Outputs

This repository contains prompts and AI-generated outputs exploring Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech-to-Text (STT) topics, with a focus on fine-tuning Whisper variants and related models.

## Repository Structure

This is primarily a collection of:
- Research prompts sent to AI assistants
- AI-generated responses and analyses
- Notes and insights from hands-on experimentation
- Technical documentation on ASR/STT model fine-tuning

## Content Organization

- **`prompts/to-run/`**: Queued prompts for future exploration
- **`prompts/processed/`**: Completed prompt-output pairs
- **`notes/`**: Consolidated insights and documentation
- **`data-preparation/`**: Data preparation workflows and scripts
- **`export/`**: Compiled PDF exports for offline reading
